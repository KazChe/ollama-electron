# Elecrtonjs + Ollama  - work in progress

## Description

This is (very) a simple project to test the integration of Electronjs with Ollama.

## How to run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should have the Ollama installed on your machine. It uses Ollama REST API endpoint `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` to respond to the requests.
